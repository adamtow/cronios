Localization files for Cronios, the shortcuts scheduler for iOS

The English.json is the default localization file for Cronios. Use it as a basis for your Cronios Localization File. 

If a localization file is missing some of the key/value pairs in the English translation, the English key/value pairs will be incorporated into localization file on build of the All Localizations dictionary.
